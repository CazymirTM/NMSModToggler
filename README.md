# NMSModToggler
I made this for people that want to toggle mods on or off really fast by just pressing one click.

(For github users downloading from here, i recommend putting the exe into a folder)
How this functions:
1. You need to choose your NMS path to mods (WHEREYOUHAVETHEGAMEINSTALLED/GAMEDATA)
2. Create MODS Folder (if you don't have it)
3. Disable or enable mods
4. Done!

Now whenever you want to disable mods fast, just open the app and click disable and the app will move the MODS folder to it's own directory (located in the same folder you extracted the app)
The same things goes for enable mods, it moves the MODS folder back to your GAMEDATA folder.


(FOR DEVS): I used Newtonsoft.json and Costura.Fody packages.
